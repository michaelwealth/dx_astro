  description: 'Nexus Innovations, a global engineering consultancy, needed a digital presence that reflected their technical excellence while being accessible to diverse international audiences. We delivered an enterprise-grade website platform that has become a key driver of their business development efforts.',
  challenge: 'Nexus operated across 12 countries with different service offerings, regulatory requirements, and cultural nuances. Their existing website was a fragmented collection of regional microsites with inconsistent branding and no unified content strategy. They needed a platform that could scale globally while allowing regional customization, all while improving their search visibility in multiple markets.',
  solution: 'We architected a headless CMS solution that separates content management from presentation, enabling regional teams to manage their content while maintaining brand consistency. The multi-language implementation goes beyond simple translation—each regional site is culturally adapted while maintaining the core Nexus story. A comprehensive SEO strategy was built into the architecture from day one, with technical foundations and content frameworks designed for international search success. The result is a platform that serves as the hub for their global digital ecosystem.',
